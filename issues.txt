T3GUI Issues
------------

[ ]Reorganize project.

   [ ]Move all source and include files to root/t3gui.

   [ ]Delete stuff we aren't going to use like cmake and demo data.

   [ ]Rename files to remove egg references.

   [ ]Replace EGG_* and egg_* with T3GUI_* and t3gui_* respectively.

   [ ]Add docs folder and put LICENSE in there.

      [ ]Add a note at the top of LICENSE stating that T3GUI is based on
         EGGDialog since it is required to not misrepresent the origin of the
         software.

[ ]Add README.

[ ]Implement theming system.

   [ ]Themes will consist of theme states that represent each possible state of
      the element. Each state will contain a nine patch bitmap and a set of
      colors (background, foreground, etc.) as well as user data which can be
      fonts or any other data the widget needs.

   [ ]Use themes exclusively for rendering. We will provide a default theme
      which will mimic the look of the Allegro 4 GUI.

      [ ]Default widgets will use nine patch bitmaps exclusively for rendering
         the overall element. This will allow us to simplify the code quite a
         bit.

[ ]Add example program.

   [ ]Example program should utilize all widgets in the default set.

   [ ]Showcase multiple dialogs mode.
